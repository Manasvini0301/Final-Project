# Final-Project
**How can machine learning models effectively predict agricultural exports, and what are the trade-offs between different models in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency?**
This project explores the use of machine learning models to predict agricultural export patterns across various commodities and regions. The study leverages Random Forest, XGBoost, and LSTM networks to analyze historical export data (2019–2022) and evaluate predictive accuracy using metrics like F1-score, R², and RMSE.

Key aspects of the project include:
✅ Data preprocessing – Feature engineering, scaling, and handling missing values
✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Identifying patterns and trends in exports
✅ Model development & evaluation – Comparing trade-offs in accuracy and computational efficiency
✅ Ethical considerations – Addressing data protection and regulatory compliance

The findings highlight the potential of machine learning for improving agricultural export forecasting and suggest future work incorporating larger datasets and more advanced architectures.
